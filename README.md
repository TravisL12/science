## Instructions
To open the demo, run any server in the main directory.

For example, with Node,

```
npm install -g http-server;
http-server;
# open localhost:8080 in chrome
```

There are two functions, `pie` and `barchart`.

Data is loaded to the global scope as `properties` and `pokemon`.

### Using the plan
The plan walks you through the various examples.
Each step has a snippet that you can run in the terminal.
Call `go()` to go to the next step of the plan.
Call `now()` to automatically run the code snippet.
